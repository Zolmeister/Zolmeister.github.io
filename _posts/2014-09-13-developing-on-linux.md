## i3 - Tiling Window Manager

A tiling window manager is a type of window manager that arranges your windows as tiles,
usually in such a way that makes managing them more efficient via keyboard shortcuts.
[i3](http://i3wm.org/) is my window manager of choice, after having used [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)
for a long time, i3 provides more flexibility and ease of configuration.

Here is a [great sceencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx0eNaGzAZU) which will help you understand the power of tiling window managers.
i3 does a great job of managing multiple workspaces, even across multiple monitors.
While developing I actively use 7 distinct workspaces across two monitors (soon probably three)
and having an efficient way of transitioning (`alt-#`) is critical to maintaining my workflow speed.

Here is a bit of config that I added to i3 (see dotfiles for the full version)

```
# Zolmeister
# disabled status bar (see above)
# screen lock with ctrl + sup + l
bindsym Control+mod4+l exec i3lock -c 000000 -i ~/Pictures/Z/Z-bg.png
# set border to 1
new_window 1pixel
# hide border if 1 window
hide_edge_borders both
# Resize Containers, Vim-style                            ($mod+Control+[hjkl])
bindsym $mod+Control+j resize grow height 5 px or 5 ppt
bindsym $mod+Control+k resize shrink height 5 px or 5 ppt
bindsym $mod+Control+l resize grow width 5 px or 5 ppt
bindsym $mod+Control+h resize shrink width 5 px or 5 ppt

## ZSH + Powerline Shell
Most shells today run [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)
however [ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is an alternative which
has great autocompletion and [other nifty feature](http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692)
For my `.zshrc` file, check my dotfiles.

In addition, the ZSH framework [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
provides some amazing features and
[shortcuts](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet),
definitely work checking out.

[Powerline shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell) is a beautiful
shell extension which takes care of drawing your prompt. I have customized it
based on my ZSH theme to include additional git hints (like Â±).

## Atom.io

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is without a doubt the best editor I have ever used.
I have used [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) (good, but bloated),
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (excellent, but not open source),
and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/?lang=en) (ok, missing quite a few features) extensively.
None of them compare to Atom (I refuse to use an editor that is not open-source, as
my editor is a core part of my development workflow and I must have full control over it).

Some day I may switch to VIM/Emacs, but have been quite happy with my working speed in Atom.

## Hardware

After [joining Clay.io](http://zolmeister.com/2014/07/cto-cofounder-clay-io.html)
I have finally gotten around to building another desktop. The only spec requirements I had
were a Linux friendly GPU (Nvidia), 32GB of RAM, and 4k monitor support.

Here is the build ([newegg wishlist](http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=25084652), missing PSU + case):

  - [28" 4K monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0JC-0007-00009)
