Last year I made a game called [Avabranch](http://avabranch.zolmeister.com/) for the [github gameoff ](https://github.com/blog/1337-github-game-off-winners)([http://www.zolmeister.com/2012/11/avabranch.html](http://www.zolmeister.com/2012/11/avabranch.html)). I decided to take a few hours and port it to mobile, so without further ado, here it is:&nbsp;[http://avabranch.zolmeister.com/m/](http://avabranch.zolmeister.com/m/)

It's listening for touch events, so if you want to use it on the desktop, you're going to need to enable touch events in the chrome dev tools settings.

I also decided to use [phone gap](http://phonegap.com/) to make it an android app:&nbsp;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Zolmeister.Avabranch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Zolmeister.Avabranch)

However the android app has a few known bugs (and some mobile browsers like google-chrome may not play the game properly). My advice is to use the firefox mobile browser, as it worked flawlessly for me the first time. There are currently no plans to fix the issues, mostly because its not my fault (it works in FF mobile, and the desktop flawlessly) and I don't feel like debugging the app, especially because the android app works perfectly on my phone (if there is enough interest I may fix the issues, but at the moment it was just an excuse to play with phone gap). Anyways, hope it works for you.
