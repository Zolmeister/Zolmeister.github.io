CharityVid allows anybody to donate to a charity of their choice absolutely free, no credit card required. The only thing we ask is that they watch a short sponsored YouTube video, and that's it.

I've been working on CharityVid for a couple months now, and now finally I'm putting it out there for the world to see. Building it has been extremely interesting from both a&nbsp;business&nbsp;and technical perspective, and I plan to start a mini series here about some of the key&nbsp;technical&nbsp;details that make up the site. I plan on covering:

*   using an AWS load balancer
*   server performance configurations
*   Zero downtime deploys
*   front end performance (page load) optimizations
*   logging, and server monitoring
*   unit testing

And a few more topics (I'll probably combine a few together). CharityVid has been my first large project to make it all the way from inception to production and I can't wait to see how it turns out.

Check it out! Let me know what you think.
