[XSS (Cross Site Scripting)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) is my personal favorite security hole. It's everywhere, on almost every site, and it's fun to exploit! I used to spend my evenings scouring the [top 500 sites](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) on alexa for XSS vulnerabilities just for fun. In addition to that I did most of my testing manually. There are tools built to automate most XSS vulnerability tests, but that's no fun. This hacking spree taught me the foundations of JavaScript and web development in general. By developing&nbsp;intricate&nbsp;tunnel exploit schemes I learned so much about how the web operates at the user level and how bugs enable hackers to get in.

My&nbsp;endeavours&nbsp;got my name here: [Google Security Hall Of Fame](http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/hall-of-fame/reward/)

Which led me to create this:&nbsp;[http://gallery.zolmeister.com/](http://gallery.zolmeister.com/)&nbsp;(click the page)

That page is my XSS gallery. The images are the websites favicons, with size&nbsp;relative&nbsp;to their ranking. I have saved nearly every one of the XSS vulnerabilities I have found by hand, which is now over 200\. Most of the sites are ones that were unhelpful or just pissed me off in general and so I took a few minutes to find an XSS vulnerability in them (I almost never report these vulnerabilities). Some however (the big icons) are ones where I started at the top of a list of most popular sites and moved my way down, collecting&nbsp;vulnerabilities&nbsp;along the way. It's pretty scary actually, knowing that even the most high profile sites are vulnerable.
